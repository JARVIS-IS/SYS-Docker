# SYS-Docker

## Overview

SYS-Docker is a utility designed to streamline the execution of your Dockerized applications. By following these simple steps, you can easily set up and manage your Docker containers.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure that you have the `screen` utility installed on your system by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install screen
    ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the main script using the following command:
   `bash
    node index.js
    `

3. **Background Execution:**
   After running the script, you can detach from the session and leave the application running in the background by pressing:
   `bash
    ctrl a + d
    `

Now your Dockerized application should be up and running, managed by SYS-Docker.

## Notes

-   Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running the script.
-   Adjust the script parameters or configurations as needed for your specific Docker setup.

Feel free to customize the README and script to fit your specific use case and requirements.
